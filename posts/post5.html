          <p>In this article I want to discuss about my decision to change my diet and what happened to my body. I will
            express my personal opinion on this so if you feel offended please get the f* out of here.
            <br><br>
            Before 4 months I decided to change something very important for my life. I decided to stop eating meat ,
            only meat not dairy products. I made this decision for two simple reasons. The first is for ethical reasons
            and the second is for improving my health. I respect any form of life and any creature deserves to live. I
            always felt a little hypocrite for eating meat as long as I don't have any health issues that demand eating
            meat. This doesn't mean that everyone who eats meats doesn't love animals or whatever,but you got the point
            . Next I will refer the benefits and disadvantages I observed in my body.
          </p>
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            As I was eating a lot of meat my whole life the first month was difficult for me. I have been around 100kg
            since I was 18 years old. For many years I was eating a lot and I was working out so I Was balancing my
            body's look, but I always wanted a more lean body. After I removed meat from my diet I saw a drastic change
            in my body. I am now 8kgs less with the same muscle mass, (yes I didn't became a skinny little bitch!) but I
            keep the same workout routine.
            <br>
            <br>
            The big amount of meat I was eating made me feel that my energy level was low. Always that was surprising to
            me because it should be the opposite. For that reason I was afraid that if I stop eating meat it will make
            me feel even more exhausted. After one month my energy is higher than before even if I my hunger feeling is
            more tense. My body is more "light", it is not stuffed and the feeling of heavy breathing has gone away.
            <br>
            Also because I have some stress-related skin problems , I had to reduce fat consumption. So eating meat
            doesn't help. After four months the skin related problems are in a good condition. Although my stress
            related issues this period are high. They are not cured because the root of the problem is my stress.
            I wont mention the other medical benefits of removing the meat from your diet. You can google them and also
            I am not a doctor my self. But I assure you the benefits are many!
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges of not eating meat is finding What to eat. OK now what I will eat with my rice
            or with my pasta. Solo rice or pasta is too plain. I love cooking, but I didnt know many recipes without
            meat. So I started googling. I started experimenting with mushrooms(not that kind of mushroom you pot head).
            Also broccoli, beans ,spinach and a lot of eggs became my everyday meals. As I mentioned eggs, I consume
            around 30 eggs(sorry chickens around the world) a week. For me is too much but this amount isn't too much
            for my health. After all this time as a vegetarian, the cooking became one of my favorite things of the day.
            <br><br>
            Another thing that I don't like as a non meat eater is the feeling of hunger. Is a little difficult to
            maintain your hunger level low without meat. But that is not a thing that makes you impractical of doing
            other things. After a while you will be able to control your hunger and even forget about it,so it wont be
            an obstacle in your routine. I mention that because no one has the time of being around veggies all the time
            when he/she feels hungry,unless you are a farmer or golf player(who loves grass...). So feeling hungry
            sometimes makes you unable to think clear about other stuff.
            And the last thing that i have observed, is that my stomach is more prone to my anxiety and spicy things
            than before. I am not sure about this as I should see a doctor about this.
            <br><br>
            My experience from not eating meat is positive with its downsides. But every drastic change like this needs
            some change time. I don't regret my decision because it makes me feel proud of my self. And also it has
            helped me to achieve my body goals.

            <br><br>
            Keep in mind that I am not a doctor and I would not recommend someone to stop eating meat. First be sure
            that there is no medical issue

          </p>
