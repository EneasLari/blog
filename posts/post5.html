  <article>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>In this article I want to discuss about my decision to change my diet and what happened to my body.
            I will express my personal opinion on this so if you are easilly offended please get the f* out of here.
            <br>
            Before 4 months I decided to change something very important for my life.
            I decided to stop eating meat. Only meta not dairy products, for two simple reasons the first is
            ethical reason and the second is for improving my health. I respect any form of life and any creature
            deserves to
            live so I always felt a little hyprocrite for eating meat as long as i dont
            have any health issues that demand eating meat.This doesnt mean that I believe
            that everyone who eats meats doesnt love animals or whatever,but you got the point I think.
            Next I will refer the benefits and disantvantages I observed in my body.
          </p>
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            As I was eating a lot of meat my whole life the first month was difficult for me. I have been around 100kg
            since I was
            18 years old. For many years I was eating a lot and I was working out so I Was balancing my body's look, but
            I always wanted
            a more lean body. After I removed meat from my diet I saw a drastic change in my body. I am now 8kgs less
            with the same muscle mass,
            (yes I didnt became a skinny little bitch!) but I keep the same workout routine.
            <br>
            The big amount of meat I was eating made me feel that my energy level was low and always that was surprising
            to
            me because it should be the opposite. For that reason I was afraid that if I stop eating meat it will make
            me
            feel even more exhausted. Surprisingly after one month my energy level are more higher than before even if
            I my hunger feeling is more tense. My body is more "light", my body is not feeling stuffed and like it cant
            breathe,
            like it was when I was eating big amount of meat.
            <br>
            Also because I have some stress-related skin problems I was supposed to reduce fat consumption from my food.
            So eating meat doesnt help. After four months the skin related problems are in a good condition even if me
            stress levels
            this period of time is very high. They are not cured because the root of the problem is my stress
            level,which is high.
            <br>
            I wont mention the other medical benefits of removing the meat from your diet because you can google them
            and also I am not
            a doctor my self.But I assure you the benefits are a lot!
          </p>
          <h3>Disantvantages</h3>

          <p>
            One of the bigest challenges of not eating meat is finding What to eat. Ok now what I will eat with my rice
            or with my
            pasta. Solo rice or pasta is too plain. I love cooking, but I didnt know many recipes without meat. So I
            started googling.
            I started experimenting with mushrooms(not that kind of mushroom you pot head), brokoli, beans ,spinach and
            a lot of eggs.
            As I mentioned eggs I consume around 30 eggs(sorry chickens arround the world) a week, for me is too much
            but i dont think that for a bodybuilder is too much.
            Quickly the cooking became one of my favourite things of the day.
            <br>
            Another thing that I dont like as a non meat eater is the feeling of hunger. Is a little difficult to
            maintain your
            hunger level low without meat, but surpsisingly that is not a thing that makes you impractical of doing
            other things.
            The feeling of hunger is something that you can control and make your brain work pretty well and forget that
            you feel a little hungry.
            I mention that because no one has the time of being around veggies all the time when he/she feels
            hungry,unless you are a farmer
            or golf player(who loves grass...). So feeling hungry sometimes makes you unable to think something else
            than your hunger.
            <br>
            And the most important thing that I think that is the result of eating veggies is that my stomach is more
            prone to my anxiety and spicy things than before.I am not sure about this as I should see a doctor about
            this.

          </p>

          <p>
            My experience from not eating meat is mainly positive with its downsides but every drastic change like this
            needs some adjustment time.I dont regret my decision because it makes me feel proud of my self for ethical
            reasons and because it has
            helped me to achieve my body goals.
          </p>
          <p>Keep in mind that I am not a doctor and I would not tell someone to stop eating meat without being sure
            that there is
            no medical reason to eat meat(which is something I want to write a whole article about).
          </p>

            That was falks,
          </p>
