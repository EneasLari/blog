          <p>The time I was NOT waiting for, just arrived. It's time for my army recruitment.</p>

          <p>Greece has universal compulsory military service for males from and over 18 years of age and I am already 27 years old, you can postpone your duty to military if you are studying in university, but only until your 28 years, so my time arrived.
           
          <p>After two years of work after university I have to stop to fulfill my obligation to military, 9 months of doing nothing and wasting time.
            I wanted to make this time more usefull, so i searched what things are possible to do while you are in military, what is your free time, 
            what are your duties and your limitations.I asked friends that they have gone through this.
            So I realised that I can study and gain new skills through this period of time, firstly I will devote more time to 
            my english proficiency certificate(so also these posts can be more readable).
            Also I want to read books, one thing that I have never done in my free time.
            Least but not least, to finish some of my Udemy courses I have bought, this is the most difficult task but also the thing I want to do the most.
            These courses are about game and web development. I think that is the most suitable time to finish these courses and be able to restart my career path.
            I am already working as a software engineer but I hate working for companies that are focused on computerization of traditional businesses. These are not creative things , 
            these are things that makes you wanna cry, they make you feel that you are not a good programmer.Maybe i am a little more dramatic but the reality for me is not so much different.

          </p>

          <p><b>Back to military please!</b> In military I want to work out a lot. A habit that I always had, but the time after break up I train like a beast, i want to maintain that. Many friends of mine 
          had gained weight in military. I asked them why , they responded "beacuse of boredom", but they already were not working out so I think for me will not be the same. I always find the motivation 
          to hit the gym and be a gorilla for an hour and a half. I will work with my inner self also. I want to be more mentally tough , I will be more selfish, more resilient to failure and rejection.
          Despite those things I will also have fun and enjoy this adventure without worries and stress. </p>
          <p>One more adventure more me! Let's see what will face, the obstacles and the oportunities. New friends ,new people, new places.</p>

          <p>Thank you for reading
